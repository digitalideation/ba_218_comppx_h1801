## Intro

This week we will look at some interesting usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNN) and will start learning about Reccurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in their different forms.

## Weekly task

Create a small experiment using a CNN. Some ideas:

+ Export the shape classifier (or another model) from Keras to Tensorflow.js / ML5.js
+ Try to run your model in the browser
+ Build a UI for the shape classifier (or another model)
+ Live image classifier (Wekinator, ML5js, TJ.js)
+ Find similar image (ML5js, TJ.js)
