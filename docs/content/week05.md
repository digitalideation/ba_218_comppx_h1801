## Intro

This week we will look at some interesting usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNN) and will start learning about Reccurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and their different forms.


## Resources

## Weekly task

Create a small experiment using a CNN. Some ideas:

<!-- + Export the shape classifier from Keras to Tensorflow.js or ML5.js
+ Build a UI for the shape classifier
+ Try to run the model in the browser
+ Try to classify shape (or a similar algorithm) using CNN
+ Live image classifier (Wekinator, ML5js, TJ.js)
+ Find similar image (ML5js, TJ.js) -->
