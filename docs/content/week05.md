## Intro

This week we will look at some interesting usage of Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets or CNN) and will start learning about Reccurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in their different forms.


## Resources

+ [RNN - Intro from ML is Fun](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/machine-learning-is-fun-part-2-a26a10b68df3)


## Weekly task

We will do that part in class most likely.

Create a small experiment using a generative RNN. Some ideas:

+ Music player 
+ A platform game level
