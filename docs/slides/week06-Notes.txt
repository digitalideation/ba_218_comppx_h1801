We haven't discussed some topics such as Reinforcement Learning so if you're interested in those you will have to make your own research

Do you want to learn the nuts and bolts of DL? Do you want to understand the general themes and try different implementation?

Interesting themes and area to focus on:
  - Models: Design and tune for performance. Might open a lot of door for your professional life.
  - Interface: very little research and resources on the subject!
  - Concrete usage: A lot of playful usage but little relevant example to solve everyday problems

How is your timeline? You will need more than 2.5 h / week if you want to explore topics in details
